 To silence this

`turbopack.root` in 
your Next.js config, 
or consider removing 
one of the lockfiles 
if it's not needed.

   Creating an optimized production build ...
 Γ¿» ERROR: This 
build is using 
Turbopack, with a 
`webpack` config and 
no `turbopack` 
config.
   This may be a 
mistake.

   As of Next.js 16 
Turbopack is enabled 
by default and
   custom webpack 
configurations may 
need to be migrated 
to Turbopack.

   NOTE: your 
`webpack` config may 
have been added by a 
configuration plugin.

   To configure 
Turbopack, see https:
//nextjs.org/docs/app
/api-reference/next-c
onfig-js/turbopack

   TIP: Many 
applications work 
fine under Turbopack 
with no 
configuration,
   if that is the 
case for you, you 
can silence this 
error by passing the
   `--turbopack` or 
`--webpack` flag 
explicitly or simply 
setting an 
   empty turbopack 
config in your Next 
config file (e.g. 
`turbopack: {}`).
