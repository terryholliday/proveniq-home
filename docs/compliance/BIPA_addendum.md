# Biometric Information Privacy Policy Addendum

**Effective Date**: December 2024  
**Version**: 1.0

## 1. Purpose

This addendum supplements MyARK's Privacy Policy to address the collection and use of biometric data as required by the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA, 740 ILCS 14) and similar state laws (Texas CUBI, Washington HB 1493).

## 2. Definitions

- **Biometric Identifier**: A retina/iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand/face geometry.
- **Biometric Information**: Any information derived from biometric identifiers used to identify an individual.

## 3. What We Collect

MyARK's **Visual Truth** feature may process images containing:
- **Item photographs**: We do NOT extract biometric identifiers from item images.
- **User profile photos**: Optional, not used for biometric identification.
- **Face geometry**: NOT COLLECTED. Visual Truth analyzes item authenticity, not human faces.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **MyARK does not collect, store, or process biometric identifiers.** Our image hashing (SHA-256) creates fingerprints of *objects*, not persons.

## 4. Third-Party AI Processing

Images are processed by Google's Gemini AI for:
- Item categorization
- Condition assessment
- Provenance verification

**Google's Data Handling**: Subject to [Google Cloud Terms](https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-addendum). Google does not use customer data for advertising or training AI models without consent.
