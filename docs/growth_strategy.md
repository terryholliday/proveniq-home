# Growth Strategy & Mechanics (Phase 3)

**Status:** Draft

## 1. Core Growth Loops

### 1.1 The "Share Auction" Loop
MyARK is inherently single-player (cataloging stuff) until a transaction occurs. Our primary viral loop is the **Auction Sharing** flow.
- **Trigger:** User creates an auction/sale.
- **Action:** User shares deep link to social/family.
- **Reward:** User gets more bids; friends discover MyARK platform via the "Bidder" role.

### 1.2 The "Digital Legacy" Loop
- **Trigger:** User designates a "Legacy Contact" (Executor/Heir).
- **Action:** Designee receives an invite to view the catalog.
- **Reward:** Peace of mind for original user; Designee onboards to MyARK to accept access.

## 2. Activation Metrics (AHA Moment)
We define a user as "Activated" when they:
1.  **Add 3 Items:** Shows commitment to cataloging.
2.  **Generate 1 Valuation:** Experiences the "Magic" of the AI.

**Target:** Increase Activation Rate from 15% -> 30% in Phase 3.

## 3. Experiments (Phase 3)
- **Referral Program:** Give $10 credit towards "Visual Truth" verifications for every friend who adds 5 items.
- **Nudges:** Push notification after 7 days of inactivity: "Did you buy anything new this week? Add it in 30 seconds."

## 4. Risks
- **Spam:** Public auction links could be botted. 
    - *Mitigation:* Captcha on unauthenticated bid attempts.
- **Value Perception:** Users may not see value in cataloging low-value items.
    - *Mitigation:* Emphasize "Total Portfolio Value" visualization (The "Net Worth" effect).
