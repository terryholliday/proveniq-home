### Insurance Carriers
*Goal: Integrate policy management and streamline claims.*

1.  **Lemonade**
    *   *Pros*: Digital-first, robust public API for quoting and binding, strong brand alignment with modern tech.
    *   *Cons*: Product range might be limited compared to traditional giants (though expanding).
2.  **Markel**
    *   *Pros*: extensive API offerings for commercial and personal lines, established reputation.
    *   *Cons*: Might be more B2B focused, integration complexity could be higher.
3.  **Great American Insurance Group**
    *   *Pros*: Commercial API solution, good for small business owners (if MyARK targets them).
    *   *Cons*: Focus might be less on personal residential compared to Lemonade.
4.  **Canopy Connect (Aggregator)**
    *   *Pros*: Access to data from 300+ carriers, simplifies integration.
    *   *Cons*: Third-party dependency, potential cost per verification.

### Legal Networks
*Goal: Connect users with estate planning professionals.*

1.  **National Association of Estate Planners & Councils (NAEPC)**
    *   *Pros*: Huge network of local councils, multidisciplinary approach (attorneys, CPAs, etc.).
    *   *Cons*: Decentralized structure might require local-level outreach.
2.  **The American College of Trust and Estate Counsel (ACTEC)**
    *   *Pros*: Premier fellowship, high credibility, access to top-tier experts.
    *   *Cons*: Exclusive membership, might be harder to penetrate for broad partnerships.
3.  **WealthCounsel**
    *   *Pros*: Provides software and resources to attorneys, natural fit for tech integration.
    *   *Cons*: Competitor overlap potential (they have their own software).

### Smart Home Integrations
*Goal: Automate asset tracking and valuation.*

1.  **Google Home / Amazon Alexa APIs**
    *   *Pros*: Broad ecosystem, can automatically detect connected devices (TVs, speakers, etc.) as assets.
    *   *Cons*: Limited to "smart" devices, privacy concerns.
2.  **Custom Inventory Apps (e.g., Home Stock API)**
    *   *Pros*: Dedicated to inventory, structured data.
    *   *Cons*: Requires user to manually input or migrate data, niche user base.

## Property Valuation Data
*Goal: Real-time property value updates.*

1.  **Zillow API**
    *   *Pros*: Industry standard, "Zestimate" is widely recognized.
    *   *Cons*: Official API is restricted, approval process required for Zestimates.
2.  **Redfin (via Third-Party)**
    *   *Pros*: High accuracy data.
    *   *Cons*: No official public API, reliance on scrapers is risky for a stable partnership.

## Value Exchange
- **For MyARK**: Enhanced feature set, user retention, data enrichment.
- **For Partners**: Access to organized user data (with consent), lead generation, reduced risk.
